Overview
Supervised machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves training models on labeled data to make predictions or decisions. This repository focuses on the key algorithms within supervised learning, including regression, classification, and ensemble methods.

Algorithms Included
Linear Regression: A basic yet powerful algorithm for predicting continuous values based on linear relationships between features and target variables.
Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification tasks, logistic regression estimates the probability of a data point belonging to a particular class.
Decision Trees: These versatile algorithms split data into branches based on feature values, enabling both classification and regression tasks.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and handle complex datasets.
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Another ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each correcting errors made by the previous ones, leading to highly accurate predictions.
Usage
Each algorithm is implemented in Python, accompanied by detailed comments and explanations to facilitate understanding. Users can explore the code, modify parameters, and experiment with different datasets to observe how these algorithms behave in various scenarios.

To get started:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
